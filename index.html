			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>The University of Wisconsin-Madison Urban and Regional Planning Workshop Course conducted a survey of parents whose children attended one or more school in Monona. The survey identifies the commute behavior of students in Monona to and back from school such as time, distance, and mode of transportation. The survey finds out why or why not the parents letting their children to walk or bike to and back from school. The result also reveals roads or intersection where parents expressed concerns for the safety of their children. Ultimately, the survey aims to shed some light on potential improvement to ensure safe route to school for the children in the City of Monona.</p>
		
			<p>From Nov 14, 2016 to Dec 1, 2016, we collected a total of 287 responses from the parents of the students who attended the following school(s):</p>	
				<ol>
					<li><a href="http://www.mononagrove.org/we/" target="_blank">Winnequah Elementary School</a> (WES)</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.mononagrove.org/mghs/" target="_blank">Monona Grove High School</a> (MGHS)</li>

		<!-- Conclusion-->
		<div class="container">
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>The survey reveals large discrepancy between potential numbers of children who can walk or bike to school and number of children who actually work or bike to school. There are close to 50% less children who actually walk or bike to school than the expected number based on their traveling distance to school. It is important to understand reasons that deter children from walking or biking to school.</p>
			<p>Parents who let their children walk or bike to school largely feel optimistic about the safety of the route to school. On the contrary, the majority of parents who do not allow their children to walk or bike feel the route to school is not at all safe or somewhat unsafe. When they are asked to identify why or why not letting their children to walk or bike to school, speed of traffic, and amount of traffic, sidewalk, and weather are the important factors cited by both sides. For children who do not walk or bike to school, parents would allowed the children to walk or bike if sidewalk, speed of traffic, and amount of traffic are improved. 
			<a id="report"></a>
			<p>The parents also identify roads and intersection that have safety concerns.In particular, Winnequah Road and Monona Drive are the most mentioned roads where parents have safety concerns for their children. In short, the result of the survey are valuable input from parents of Monona that can provide directions on how to improve the safe route to school in the future.
